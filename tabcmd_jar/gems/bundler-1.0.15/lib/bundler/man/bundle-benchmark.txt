NAME
       bundle-benchmark - Display the time taken for each gem to be loaded

SYNOPSIS
       bundle benchmark [group]

DESCRIPTION
       This command loads all your required dependencies as per Bundler.setup,
       and displays the total time spent in requiring each gem and its	depen-
       dencies.

       Use  this  command  to  track down problems with excessive boot time in
       your application, or to optimize specific groups in  your  Gemfile  for
       fast setup.

GROUP OPTION
       To  test the load times for gems in a specific group, pass the group as
       an argument to bundle benchmark. Omitting this option loads all	depen-
       dencies in your Gemfile.
